Trivia Game

## Purpose:
Trivia Game is a browser game which asks you 6 questions.

## Description:
In this project you are presented with a page displaying a question, four answers, and a timer.  The question is hidden when either you select an answer or you run out of time.  If you select an answer it will display remaining time until next question is shown and whether or not you answered correctly.  Once it runs out of time on the answer display or you ran out of time on the question, then a new question and answers is displayed with the timers reset.  At the end of all questions the game automatically resets.

## Tech Used:
To accomplish this, the app utilizes jQuery and timers.
